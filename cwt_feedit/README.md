Typo3 Extension "CWT Feedit"
===============================

What does it do?
-----------------
This extension features semi-automatic rendering of frontend user input forms for (custom) Typo3 content types. Thereby it makes heavy use of the meta information already defined in your Typo3 installation. This makes it very easy to create form-based applications in no time. You just have to configure the CWT Frontend Edit Extension with a few lines of code and then it handles everything else. The extension currently features the following:

* Automatic rendering of Input, Textarea, Select, Password, Checkbox and File types.
* Automatic input validation (from TCA) for input, Textarea, Select, Password and File types.
* Additional input validation possible (email, atLeast, atMost ...) for Input, Textarea, Select, Password and File types.
* Customizable form layout via CSS.
